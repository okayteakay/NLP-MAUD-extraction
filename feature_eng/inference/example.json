to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation of such merger (the

approved and declared the advisability of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) directed that this Agreement be submitted to the sole stockholder of Merger Sub for its adoption and recommended that the sole stockholder of Merger Sub adopt this Agreement\u037e \n\n\nWHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as an inducement to the willingness of Parent and US Holdco to enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company who collectively hold approximately 24% of the outstanding votes of Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nCommon Stock (the \u201cPrincipal Stockholders\u201d) are entering into an agreement (the \u201cCompany Voting Agreement\u201d) with Parent pursuant to

The Merger shall become effective upon the due filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State or at such subsequent time and date as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the \u201cEffective Time\u201d). \n\n\n1.3 Closing. The Closing shall take place remotely via the electronic exchange of counterpart signature pages as soon as practicable (but in any event no later than the fourth Business Day) following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted herein and by Applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of such conditions at the Closing) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement, or at such other date, time or place as the parties hereto shall agree in writing. \n\n\n1.4 Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time (a) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, (b) the certificate of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and restated in its 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nentirety to read as set forth on Exhibit A, and as so amended and restated shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter further amended in accordance with its terms and the DGCL, and (c) the bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and restated in their entirety to read as set forth on Exhibit B, and as so amended and restated shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter further amended in accordance with their terms, the terms of the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, and the DGCL. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL and in this Agreement. \n\n\n1.5 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. As of the Effective Time, the parties hereto shall take all necessary action such that the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case to hold office in accordance with the term of office set forth in certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and until their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal. \n\n\nARTICLE II TREATMENT OF COMPANY SECURITIES \n\n\n2.1 Conversion of Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub, US Holdco, Parent or the holder of any shares of the capital stock of the Company or capital stock of Merger Sub: \n\n\n(a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. \n\n\n(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. All shares of Company Common Stock that are held in the treasury of the Company and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, Parent, US Holdco, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be paid or delivered in exchange therefor. \n\n\n(c) Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock. Subject to Section 2.2, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and (ii) any Dissenting Shares) (such shares of Company Common Stock, other than those contemplated by the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), \u201cEligible Shares\u201d) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive $20.85, without interest thereon (the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d). As of the Effective Time and upon the conversion thereof, all Eligible Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares representing Eligible Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2. 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(d) Adjustments to Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this Section 2.1(d) shall be construed to permit any party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision in this Agreement. \n\n\n2.2 Surrender of Certificates. \n\n\n(a) Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, (i) Parent and US Holdco shall enter into an agreement (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company) with the Paying Agent for the Paying Agent to act as paying agent for the Merger (the \u201cPaying Agent Agreement\u201d) and (ii) Parent shall, and shall cause US Holdco to, deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Eligible Shares, for payment through the Paying Agent in accordance with this Section 2.2, the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than as set forth in this Section 2.2. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by US Holdco\u037e provided, however, (A) that any such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, (B) that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable hereunder and (C) US Holdco shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Payment Fund includes at all times cash sufficient to satisfy US Holdco\u2019s obligation to pay the Merger Consideration under this Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments (net of any losses) shall be paid to US Holdco or the Surviving Corporation, as US Holdco directs, pursuant to Section 2.2(e). In the event the Payment Fund is diminished below the level required for the Paying Agent to make prompt cash payments as required under Section 2.2(b), including any such diminishment as a result of investment losses, Parent or US Holdco shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, immediately deposit additional cash into the Payment Fund in an amount equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payments. \n\n\n(b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable (and no later than the third Business Day) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail or otherwise provide notice to each holder of record of Eligible Shares that are (i) represented by Certificates or (ii) Book-Entry Shares not held through the Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d), advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, which notice shall include (A) appropriate transmittal materials (including a letter of transmittal (the \u201cLetter of Transmittal\u201d)), which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates, as provided in Section 2.2(g)) or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent (which shall be deemed to have been effected upon the delivery of a customary \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d with respect to such Book-Entry Shares or such other reasonable evidence, if any, of such surrender as the Paying Agent may reasonably request pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Paying Agent Agreement) and shall 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nbe in such form and have such other provisions as Parent shall reasonably designate and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates, as provided in Section 2.2(g)) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. With respect to Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent, DTC and such other necessary or desirable third-party intermediaries to ensure that the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, upon surrender of Eligible Shares held of record by DTC or its nominees in accordance with DTC\u2019s customary surrender procedures and such other procedures as agreed by Parent, the Company, the Paying Agent, DTC and such other necessary or desirable third-party intermediaries, the Merger Consideration to which the beneficial owners thereof are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. \n\n\n(c) Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Eligible Shares that (i) are represented by Certificates, by physical surrender of such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates, as provided in Section 2.2(g)) together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent, (ii) are Book-Entry Shares not held through the DTC, by book-receipt of an \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d by the Paying Agent in connection with the surrender of Book-Entry Shares (or such other reasonable evidence, if any, of surrender with respect to such Book-Entry Shares, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Paying Agent Agreement), in each of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 2.2(c), pursuant to such materials and instructions as contemplated by Section 2.2(b), or (iii) are Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, in accordance with DTC\u2019s customary surrender procedures and such other procedures as agreed by the Company, Parent, the Paying Agent, DTC and such other necessary or desirable third-party intermediaries pursuant to Section 2.2(b), the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement (subject to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.5). In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer or stock records of the Company, any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock may be paid to such a transferee if such Certificate is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company. \n\n\n(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, all holders of Company Common Stock outstanding prior to the Effective Time, whether such shares were represented by Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company other than, subject to Applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares, the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement at the Effective Time upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\naccordance with Section 2.2(c), without interest and subject to any required Tax withholdings. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding prior to the Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for any reason, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II, subject to Applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares. \n\n\n(e) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Book- Entry Shares for one year after the Effective Time (including all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it) shall be delivered to US Holdco, upon demand, and any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares who has not previously complied with this Section 2.2 shall be entitled to receive only from US Holdco or the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, without interest. \n\n\n(f) No Liability. Subject to Applicable Law, none of Parent, US Holdco, the Company, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Payment Fund or the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Subject to Applicable Law, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any portion of the Merger Consideration that remains undistributed to and unclaimed by the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares as of immediately prior to the date on which such portion of the Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. \n\n\n(g) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if reasonably required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as the Paying Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Payment Fund, US Holdco or the Surviving Corporation) may determine is reasonably necessary, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent (or if subsequent to the termination of the Payment Fund and subject to Section 2.2(e), US Holdco) shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby pursuant to this Agreement. \n\n\n2.3 Company Stock Plans. \n\n\n(a) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is then outstanding and unvested shall automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock then underlying such Company RSU multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(b) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company PSU that is then outstanding and unvested shall automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that vest upon a Sale of the Company (as defined in the Company LTIP) pursuant to the applicable Company PSU grant terms multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. \n\n\n(c) Parent and US Holdco shall (i) cause the Surviving Corporation to make the payments contemplated by the foregoing Section 2.3(a) and Section 2.3(b) as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event, as to any Person who is a holder of Company RSUs or Company PSUs, by the later of seven Business Days following each such Person\u2019s compliance with any written instructions provided to such Person by the Company pursuant to Section 2.3(d), and seven Business Days after the Effective Time and (ii) cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain at all times from and after the Effective Time sufficient liquid funds to satisfy its obligations pursuant to Section 2.3(a) and Section 2.3(b). \n\n\n(d) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall mail or electronically transmit to each Person who is a holder of Company RSUs or Company PSUs a letter describing the treatment of and payment for such equity awards pursuant to this Section 2.3 and providing any applicable instructions for use in obtaining payment therefor. \n\n\n(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that are necessary (under the Company Stock Plan and award agreements pursuant to which Company RSUs and Company PSUs are outstanding or otherwise) to (i) effect the measures contemplated by this Section 2.3, including but not limited to the adoption of any plan amendments, obtaining the approval of the Company Board, obtaining any necessary employee consents or providing any necessary employee notices and (ii) cause there to be no rights to acquire Company Common Stock following the Effective Time. \n\n\n(f) The Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate the Company Stock Plan effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and to provide that following the Effective Time, no participant in the Company Stock Plan shall have any right under the Company Stock Plan other than the right to receive the payments in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.3. Parent and US Holdco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, subject to Section 2.5, pay through its payroll system the amounts due pursuant to Section 2.3(a) and Section 2.3(b). \n\n\n2.4 Dissenting Shares. \n\n\n(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1, but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nshall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights set forth in Section 262 under the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost such holder\u2019s right to appraisal under the DGCL. \n\n\n(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (by the holder thereof effectively withdrawing, failing to perfect, or otherwise losing such holder\u2019s appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the date of loss of such status, such shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1, without interest, and shall not thereafter be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. \n\n\n(c) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt notice of any written demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such demand\u037e and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument unless Parent shall have given its prior written consent to such payment or settlement offer. \n\n\n2.5 Withholding Rights. Each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, US Holdco, Merger Sub and the Paying Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, any amounts it is required to deduct or withhold with respect to the making of such payment under applicable federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that any amounts are so deducted, withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. \n\n\nARTICLE III REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY \n\n\nExcept (a) as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed or furnished on or after January 1, 2020 and one Business Day prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding any risk factor disclosures contained under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d or any disclosure of risks included or referenced under the heading \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d sections in such filings or similar forward-looking statements of risks contained therein that are both non- specific, predictive and cautionary in nature)\u037e provided that no such disclosure shall be deemed to modify or qualify the representations and warranties made in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.21, 3.22 or 3.23, unless such representation or warranty includes an explicit reference that information has been \u201cmade 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\navailable\u201d to Parent\u037e or (b) as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule, subject to Section 10.13, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent, US Holdco and Merger Sub as follows: \n\n\n3.1 Organization, Standing and Power.

Merger Sub is a wholly owned Subsidiary of US Holdco formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions, has engaged in no other business activities and has conducted its operations only as contemplated by this Agreement. \n\n\n4.5 Financing. \n\n\n(a) Parent, US Holdco and Merger Sub will have, upon consummation of both the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing, as of the Effective Time, sufficient cash on hand for the satisfaction of all of their obligations under this Agreement, including payment of (i) the aggregate Merger Consideration\u037e (ii) repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by, or required in connection with the transactions described in this Agreement, the Placing Agreement or the Debt Financing Documents\u037e (iii) any other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions (including all amounts payable in respect of Company RSUs and Company PSUs under this Agreement)\u037e and (iv) all related fees and expenses of Parent, US Holdco, Merger Sub and reimbursable expenses of the Company (collectively, the \u201cPayment Obligations\u201d).

As of the date hereof, subject to all legal reservations and perfection requirements, the Financing Documents are (A) legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent, and to the knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, (B) enforceable in accordance with their respective terms against Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, in each case except as such enforceability may be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception and (C) in full force and effect.

The only conditions precedent or other contingencies (including market \u201cflex\u201d provisions) related to the obligations of Numis Securities Limited, Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co.

an unsolicited inquiry, to refer the inquiring person to the terms of this Section 6.1 and to limit its communication exclusively to such referral or (y) upon receipt of a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal from any person that did not result from a material breach of this Section 6.1, solely to the extent necessary to ascertain facts or clarify terms with respect to an

None of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall enter into any confidentiality agreement or other agreement subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from (x) providing to Parent or any of its Affiliates or Representatives the information required to be provided pursuant to this Section 6.1 or (y) otherwise complying with this Section 6.1. \n\n\n(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) promptly (but in no event more than one Business Day after the date hereof) request any Person that has executed a currently in-effect confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement in connection with any actual or potential Acquisition Proposal to promptly after the date of such request return or destroy all confidential information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the possession of such Person or its Representatives, (ii) on the date of this Agreement, terminate all physical and electronic data room access previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives and (iii) commencing on the date of this Agreement prohibit any third party from having access to any physical or electronic data room access relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

The Company shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent if the Company Board makes a determination that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal or if the Company furnishes information or enters into discussions or negotiations as provided in this Section 6.1(c). 41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(d) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 48 hours after receipt) notify (orally and in writing) Parent in the event that the Company or any of its Representatives receives an Acquisition Proposal or a request for information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries that constitutes, contemplates or could reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, including the identity of the person making the Acquisition Proposal and copies of all written materials related thereto (or, if oral, a description of the material terms and conditions thereof). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, as to the status of (including any material developments, discussions or negotiations) such Acquisition Proposal (including by as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 48 hours after receipt) providing to Parent a description of any changes to the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal). \n\n\n(e) Except as expressly permitted by Section 6.1(f), the Company Board shall not (i) (A) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in, or remove the Company Board Recommendation from, the Proxy Statement, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent and its Affiliates, the Company Board Recommendation or (C) adopt, approve, authorize or recommend to stockholders of the Company, or resolve to or publicly propose or announce its intention to adopt, approve, authorize or recommend to stockholders of the Company any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as an \u201cCompany Board Recommendation Change\u201d) or (ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement (including an acquisition agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement or other agreement), commitment or agreement in principle with respect to, or reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, whether binding or nonbinding (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with Section 6.1(c)) (an \u201cAcquisition Agreement\u201d). \n\n\n(f) Anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement notwithstanding, prior to the time that the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the Company Board may, with respect to a bona fide, unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material breach of this Section 6.1, make a Company Board Recommendation Change or cause the Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(f) in order to substantially concurrently with such termination enter into a definitive agreement relating to such Acquisition Proposal if and only if, prior to taking either such action, (i) the Company has complied with its obligations under this Section 6.1, (ii) the Company Board has determined, in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (iii) the Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law\u037e provided, that prior to making such Company Board Recommendation Change or effecting such termination (and prior to making the determination set forth in clause (iii)), (A) the Company has given Parent at least four Business Days\u2019 prior notice of its intention to take 42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nsuch action, specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the person making, any such Acquisition Proposal and has contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy of the Acquisition Proposal, a copy of any proposed Acquisition Agreements and a copy of any financing commitments relating thereto (or, in each case, if not provided in writing to the Company, a written summary of the terms and conditions thereof), (B) the Company shall have negotiated, in good faith, with Parent and its Representatives during such notice period (if, and to the extent, Parent has indicated its desire to negotiate to the Company) to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, (C) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall have considered, in good faith, any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent (and not revoked), and shall have determined, in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the Acquisition Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed in writing by Parent (and not revoked) were to be given effect and (D) in the event of any change to any of the financial terms (including the form, amount, mix and timing of payment of consideration) or any other material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (A) of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (A) of this proviso shall commence (except that the four Business Day notice period referred to in clause (A) of this proviso shall instead be equal to the longer of (x) three Business Days and (y) the period remaining under the notice period under clause (A) of this proviso immediately prior to the delivery of such additional notice under this clause (D)) during which time the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.1(f) anew with respect to such additional notice, including clauses (A) through (D) above of this proviso\u037e provided, however, that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.1(f) and Section 8.1(f) unless the Company pays, or causes to be paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b) substantially concurrently with such termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, except as otherwise expressly contemplated by Section 8.1(f)(iii), neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any Acquisition Agreement unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms. \n\n\n(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the time that the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the Company Board may make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event if and only if, prior to taking such action, (i) the Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law\u037e (ii) the Company has given Parent at least three Business Days\u2019 notice of its intention to make a Company Board Recommendation Change, specifying the reasons for the Company Board Recommendation Change\u037e and (iii) the Company negotiates in good faith with Parent and its Representatives during such notice period (if and to the extent Parent has indicated its desire to negotiate with the Company) to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause the Company to conclude that a Company Board Recommendation Change is no longer necessary. 43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(h) The Company shall ensure that any withdrawal or modification of the Company Board Recommendation: (i) does not change or otherwise affect the approval of this Agreement by the Company Board and (ii) does not have the effect of causing any Takeover Law to be applicable to this Agreement or any of the Company Voting Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions. \n\n\n(i) Nothing contained in this Section 6.1 shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or complying with Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer), (ii) making any legally required (based upon the advice of outside counsel) disclosure to stockholders with regard to the Transactions or an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) making any \u201cstop, look and listen\u201d communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position thereunder\u037e provided, that, in the case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Section 6.1(i), no such action or disclosure that would amount to an Company Board Recommendation Change shall be permitted, made or taken other than in compliance with this Section 6.1. \n\n\n6.2 New York Stock Exchange Delisting\u037e Deregistration. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and, following the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation, shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under Applicable Law and rules and policies of the New York Stock Exchange, to cause the delisting of the Company and of the shares of Company Common Stock from the New York Stock Exchange as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and the deregistration of the shares of Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting from the New York Stock Exchange.

Any such information shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. Prior to the Closing, none of Parent, US Holdco or Merger Sub shall (and each shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives not to) contact or communicate with any of the employees, customers, licensors, distributors or suppliers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions without the prior written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

The Company, on one hand, and Parent, US Holdco and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall each use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any Applicable Law in connection with the Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Section 6.4(a) shall limit any obligation under any other provision in this Section 6.4 and no party hereto shall be in violation of this Agreement by virtue of providing information that is competitively sensitive to one another on an \u201coutside counsel only\u201d or other basis designed to ensure compliance with Applicable Law (including the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws). \n\n\n(b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 6.4, Parent and the Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, file with CFIUS a formal joint voluntary notice in connection with the Transactions (the \u201cJoint Voluntary Notice\u201d).

Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper, or advisable to obtain CFIUS Clearance, as promptly as practicable. The Company and Parent agree that if the Company and Parent jointly determine it to be appropriate that the parties withdraw and resubmit the Joint Voluntary Notice submitted to CFIUS pursuant to this Section 6.4(b), the Company and Parent shall cooperate in withdrawing and resubmitting the Joint Voluntary Notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.4(b) (including the obligation to use reasonable best efforts) shall require, or be construed to require, Parent or any of its Affiliates to agree to, offer, accept or suffer to have imposed upon it, any condition or mitigation that would require Parent to (i) sell, hold separate, divest, license or discontinue, before or after the Effective Time, any material assets, businesses, or interests of Parent and its Subsidiaries (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company and the Surviving Corporation), taken as a whole\u037e or (ii) accept any conditions or restrictions on the Company or its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

None of Parent, US Holdco, Merger Sub or the Company shall commit to or agree with any Governmental Entity to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws or enter into a timing agreement with any Governmental Entity, without the prior written consent of the other parties. \n\n\n(d) Subject to the terms hereof, and without limiting the parties\u2019 obligations under Section 6.4(e), the parties hereto shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any Regulatory Approval, to respond to any government requests for information relating to any Regulatory Approval, to cause any waiting periods under any Applicable Laws relating to any Regulatory Approval to expire or be terminated, and to contest and resist any action, including any legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Restrictive Order. The parties hereto shall consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties in advance, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings relating to any Regulatory Approval. To the extent permitted by law or Governmental Entities reviewing the Transactions, the parties will provide each other the opportunity to participate in meetings and other substantive conversations with any such Governmental Entities in connection with the Transactions described herein. 47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(e) In furtherance of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.4, and notwithstanding any limitations therein or elsewhere in this Agreement, but subject to the other provisions of this Section 6.4(e), Parent shall promptly take (and shall cause each of its Affiliates to take) any and all actions necessary or advisable in order to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment to the consummation of the Transactions and obtain all approvals and consents under any Antitrust Laws that may be required by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or local Governmental Entity, in each case with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties to consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable (and in any event by or before the Outside Date), including committing to, by consent decree or otherwise, operational restrictions or limitations on, and committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust or otherwise, the sale, license, disposition or holding separate of such assets or businesses of Parent, US Holdco, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates (and the entry into agreements with, and submission to decrees, judgments, injunctions or orders of the relevant Governmental Entity) as may be required to obtain such approvals or consents of such Governmental Entities or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any decrees, judgments, injunctions or orders that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the consummation of the Transactions\u037e provided that, nothing in this Section 6.4(e) shall require or be construed to require Parent or any of its Affiliates to agree to, offer, accept or suffer to have imposed upon it (i) any divestiture or license of any material assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company and the Surviving Corporation), taken as a whole, (ii) any agreement to hold separate or discontinue operation of any material assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company and the Surviving Corporation), taken as a whole or (iii) any conditions or restrictions that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. If requested by Parent, the Company shall make, subject to the condition that the Transactions actually occur, any undertakings (including undertakings to accept operational restrictions or limitations or to make sales or other dispositions, provided that such restrictions, limitations, sales or other dispositions are conditioned upon the consummation of the Transactions) as are required to obtain any Regulatory Approval or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any Restrictive Order\u037e provided, however, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be obligated to make any undertaking that could result in any penalty or fine (whether criminal, civil, or otherwise) upon, or any other liability to, any Person that is, prior to the Effective Time, a stockholder of the Company or a director, officer, or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. None of Parent, US Holdco, Merger Sub or the Company, directly or indirectly, through one or more of their respective Affiliates, shall take any action, including acquiring or making any investment in any person or any division or assets thereof, that would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the satisfaction of any of the conditions contained in Article VII or the consummation of the Merger. \n\n\n(f) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 6.4, each of Parent and the Company shall promptly prepare and file a 60-day notice pursuant to Section 122.4(b) of the ITAR.

The Parent Announcements and any other press release announcing the execution of this Agreement shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and Parent. Except as may be required by law or stock market regulations, and except as provided in Sections 6.1 and 6.12, Parent and the Company shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any other press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement\u037e provided, however, that these restrictions shall not apply to any Company or Parent communications (i) in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, Trigger Event or Company Board Recommendation Change (except as required under Section 6.1) or (ii) that are consistent in all material respects with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by a party hereto in accordance with this Section 6.5, including investor conference calls, filings with the SEC, FCA or London Stock Exchange, or Q&As or other publicly disclosed documents. Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall limit the ability of the Company or Parent to make any internal announcements to their respective employees that are consistent with the prior public disclosures made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement regarding the Transactions. \n\n\n6.6 Director and Officer Indemnification. \n\n\n(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of US Holdco and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, manager, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, while an officer, director, manager or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is or was serving at the request of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries as an officer, director, manager, employee or agent of another Person, in each case in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by law. Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) incurred in the defense of any such Proceeding from each of US Holdco and the Surviving Corporation within ten Business Days of receipt by US Holdco or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor\u037e provided that any Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides a written undertaking to repay such advances if it is determined by a final determination of a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal) that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification under Applicable Law. The indemnification agreements with the Company\u2019s directors and officers that survive the Merger shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. \n\n\n(b) From the Effective Time through the six-year anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and US Holdco shall cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions that are no less favorable with respect to 49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nindemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of individuals who, at the Effective Time, were current or former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement. \n\n\n(c) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall, at its option, either (i) purchase, or cause US Holdco to purchase, a six-year extended reporting period endorsement (a \u201cReporting Tail Endorsement\u201d) with respect to the Current D&O Insurance so long as the premium therefor would not be in excess of the Maximum Premium or (ii) allow the Company to arrange for the purchase of a Reporting Tail Endorsement with a premium therefor not in excess of the Maximum Premium\u037e provided, however, that in the case of (i) and (ii), in the event the premium would exceed the Maximum Premium, the Company, Parent or US Holdco, as applicable, shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost equal to such amount. Parent, US Holdco and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such Reporting Tail Endorsement in full force and effect for its full six-year term. If either the Reporting Tail Endorsement or the Company\u2019s or the Surviving Corporation\u2019s existing insurance expires, is terminated or is canceled during such six-year period (or, with respect to such existing insurance, the annual premium in respect thereof exceeds the Maximum Premium), the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and Parent and US Holdco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, as much directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for a premium that is, when taken together with the premium paid for the Reporting Tail Endorsement, not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the Current D&O Insurance. \n\n\n(d) In the event US Holdco or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of US Holdco or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall expressly assume and succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6. \n\n\n(e) If any Indemnified Party makes any claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 6.6 that is denied by US Holdco or the Company or the Surviving Corporation, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Party is entitled to such indemnification or advancement of expenses, then US Holdco, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall pay the Indemnified Party\u2019s costs and expenses, including legal fees and expenses, incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with pursuing his or her claims to the fullest extent permitted by law. \n\n\n(f) From and after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall cause US Holdco and the Surviving Corporation (including their respective successors and permitted assignees) to comply with all of their respective obligations under this Section 6.6. \n\n\n(g) The provisions of this Section 6.6 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Section 6.6(f)) are intended to be in addition to the rights otherwise available to any Indemnified Party by law, charter, statute, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their representatives. 50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n6.7 Notification of Certain Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent (in any case within two Business Days of discovery thereof) of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, development, circumstance or change which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably expected to cause any representation or warranty of such Person (or, in case of Parent\u2019s obligation to provide notice, any representation or warranty of US Holdco or Merger Sub) contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate (i) in the case of any representation or warranty of the Company, in any manner that would result in the failure of the condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) or (ii) in the case of any representation or warranty of Parent, US Holdco or Merger Sub, in any manner that would result in the failure of the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a), (b) any material failure by such Person (or, in case of Parent\u2019s obligation to provide notice, any material breach by US Holdco or Merger Sub) to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement set forth in this Agreement or (c) any written notice or other written communication from any Governmental Entity alleging that the Merger requires the consent or approval of such Governmental Entity. The parties hereto agree that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall not, in and of itself, affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Transactions or the remedies available to the parties hereunder. \n\n\n6.8 Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by Section 2.3 and any dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. \n\n\n6.9 Financing. \n\n\n(a) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and subject only to the conditions set forth in the Financing Documents, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect and comply with the Financing Documents, (ii) satisfy (and cause its Affiliates to satisfy) on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and its Affiliates in the Financing Documents (or, if necessary or deemed advisable by Parent, seek consents or waivers of conditions applicable to Parent or its applicable Subsidiary contained in such Financing Document), (iii) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the time the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 1.3, including using reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and other Persons party to the Debt Financing Documents to fund the Debt Financing, (iv) conduct the Share Issue in accordance with the Parent Announcements (or any amendment or supplement thereto) and otherwise consummate the Equity Financing, including to cause the joint bookrunners and lead managers to procure subscribers for, and if such subscribers cannot be procured or default in their subscription, subscribe as principal, for any ordinary shares in the capital of Parent not properly subscribed and paid for in connection with the Share Issue in accordance with the terms of the Placing Agreement, (v) enforce its rights under the Financing Documents, and (vi) comply with its covenants and other obligations under the 51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nFinancing Documents.

As soon as reasonably practicable, Parent shall provide any additional information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in the immediately preceding sentence\u037e provided that Parent shall not be required to provide any such additional information to the extent disclosure would be prohibited under Applicable Law or such disclosure could reasonably be expected to result in a waiver of attorney-client privilege (it being understood that (x) this proviso does not limit Parent\u2019s 52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nobligations under the immediately preceding sentence and (y) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such information in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege).

information that the Company reasonably deems to be competitively sensitive information or the provision of which could reasonably be expected to be materially damaging to the Company\u2019s or its Subsidiaries\u2019 relationships with their customers or employees)).

Nothing contained in this Section 6.9 or otherwise shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be a borrower or obligor with respect to the Financing prior to the Effective Time. \n\n\n(e) In no event shall Parent or any of its Affiliates (which for purposes of this Section 6.9(e) shall be deemed to include each direct or indirect investor or potential investor in Parent or any of Parent\u2019s or any such investor\u2019s financing sources or potential financing sources or other Representatives), without the prior written consent of the Company, (i) award any agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other firm or person except Numis Securities Limited, Joh.

Without in any way limiting any party\u2019s rights or obligations under this Agreement, (a) nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give Parent, US Holdco or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to (i) control or direct the Company\u2019s or the Company\u2019s Subsidiaries\u2019 operations prior to the Effective Time or (ii) any information the Company reasonably deems to be competitively sensitive information or the provision of which could reasonably be expected to be materially damaging to the Company\u2019s or its Subsidiaries\u2019 relationships with their customers or employees, (b) prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries\u2019 operations and (c) notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no consent of Parent, US Holdco or Merger Sub shall be required with respect to any matter set forth in Section 5.1 or elsewhere in this Agreement to the extent that the requirement of such consent would reasonably be expected to violate any Applicable Law. \n\n\n6.11 Security Holder Litigation. Each of Parent and the Company shall notify the other party of any Proceeding brought, or threatened, against such party or its directors or officers relating to the Merger or the Transactions promptly after becoming aware of such Proceeding. The Company shall give Parent the right to participate, at Parent\u2019s expense, in the defense or settlement of any such Proceeding against the Company (including the reasonable opportunity to review and comment in advance on all filings or written responses to be made by the Company in connection with any such Proceeding). No compromise or full or partial settlement of any such Proceeding shall be agreed to by the Company without Parent\u2019s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n6.12 Preparation of Proxy Statement\u037e Company Stockholders Meeting. \n\n\n(a) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in any event, within 20 Business Days thereafter (subject to Parent\u2019s reasonable cooperation), the Company shall (i) prepare (with Parent\u2019s reasonable cooperation) and file with the SEC a proxy statement (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the \u201cProxy Statement\u201d) to be sent to the stockholders of the Company relating to a special meeting of the Company\u2019s stockholders (the \u201cCompany Stockholders Meeting\u201d) to consider, among other matters, the adoption of this Agreement, and (ii) set a record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting and commence a broker search pursuant to Section 14a-13 of the Exchange Act in connection therewith. Parent shall furnish all information concerning Parent, US Holdco and Merger Sub to the Company as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable after such filing (including by responding to comments of the SEC on a timely and expeditious basis).

Following the Proxy Statement having been cleared by the SEC (or after 10 calendar days have passed since the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC without notice from the SEC of its intent to review the Proxy Statement), the Company shall cause the Proxy Statement, promptly following the calling of the Company Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, to be mailed to its stockholders and to be filed as required with the SEC. If, at any time prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain, before the stockholders of the Company have voted, any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall promptly be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required under Applicable Law, disseminated to stockholders of the Company\u037e provided that the delivery of such notice and the filing of any such amendment or supplement shall not affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by any party hereunder or otherwise affect the remedies available to any party hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto, as applicable) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (A) shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and (B) shall give due consideration to any comments proposed by Parent. 58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(b) Unless the Company Board has made a Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company shall (i) through the Company Board, recommend to its stockholders that they adopt this Agreement and include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (ii) duly take all lawful action pursuant its certificate of incorporation, bylaws, the rules of the New York Stock Exchange and the DGCL to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as promptly as practicable following the date hereof, for the purpose of (A) obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (B) voting on a proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting and (C) if applicable, the advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection therewith, (iii) subject to any Company Board Recommendation Change that the Company Board is permitted to make, take all lawful action to solicit the adoption of this Agreement by the Company\u2019s stockholders\u037e provided, however, that the Company Board shall be permitted to adjourn, delay or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Applicable Law (but not beyond the Outside Date) (A) if the Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with legal counsel that the failure to so adjourn, delay or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, (B) to the extent necessary to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with legal counsel is required under Applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Company\u2019s stockholders prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, (C) to the extent required by a court of competent jurisdiction in connection with any Proceedings in connection with this Agreement, (D) if there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) at the Company Stockholders Meeting to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business or (E) to permit the solicitation of additional proxies if the Company reasonably believes it may be necessary to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. \n\n\n6.13 Takeover Laws. If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the Transactions, each of Parent and the Company and the members of their respective boards of directors shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and conditions contemplated hereby and otherwise act to lawfully eliminate the effect of any Takeover Law on any of the Transactions. \n\n\n6.14 Share Admission. Parent shall use its best efforts to cause the Share Admission to occur as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Placing Agreement. \n\n\n6.15 Approval by Sole Stockholder of Merger Sub.

basis, an annual base salary or base wage rate (as applicable) and a target annual cash bonus opportunity or target cash commissions opportunity that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the annual base salary or base wage rate (as applicable) and target annual cash bonus opportunity or target cash commissions opportunity in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company Employee Plans, and (B) on a group basis, employee benefit plans and arrangements (other than base salaries or base wages, bonus opportunities, severance benefits, defined benefit pension, nonqualified deferred compensation, retiree or post- termination health or welfare benefit, equity or equity based compensation and retention or change in control-related compensation or benefits (collectively, the \u201cSpecified Arrangements\u201d)) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee benefit plans and arrangements (other than the Specified Arrangements) provided to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company Employee Plans. \n\n\n(b) Without limiting Parent\u2019s obligations under Section 6.16(a), Parent shall maintain (or cause an affiliate of Parent to maintain) the Company\u2019s Short-Term Incentive Plan (the \u201cSTIP\u201d), as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, until at least the end of calendar year 2021, and shall pay (or cause an affiliate of Parent to pay) to each Continuing Employee who was a participant in the STIP immediately prior to the Closing Date an award thereunder for calendar year 2021, in accordance with the terms thereof (including achievement of all applicable performance measures), with such modifications, if any, to the performance objectives as are appropriate to reflect the Transactions, subject to each such Continuing Employee\u2019s continued employment with Parent or an affiliate thereof through December 31, 2021, payable at such time(s) as Parent may determine, but in no event later than March 15, 2022, and in each case determined in accordance with the calculation principles set forth on Section 6.16(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule\u037e provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, each such Continuing Employee\u2019s payout under the STIP in respect of calendar year 2021 shall be no less than such employee would have received under the STIP as in effect as of the date of this Agreement\u037e provided, further, that, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall not interpret, amend or modify the STIP in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of any participant under the STIP in respect of calendar year 2021. \n\n\n(c) If requested by Parent at least 15 days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall adopt written resolutions of the appropriate governing body in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent (copies of which shall be provided to Parent prior to the Closing), to terminate each Company Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (the \u201cCompany 401(k) Plan\u201d), and to fully vest all participants under such Company 401(k) Plan, such termination and vesting to be effective no later than the Business Day preceding the Closing Date\u037e provided, however, that the Company 401(k) Plan termination and full vesting of participants thereunder may be made contingent upon the consummation of the Transactions. \n\n\n(d) With respect to any 401(k) plan of the Surviving Corporation and any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility to participate, level of benefits and 60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nvesting, and accrual of vacation and paid-time-off, each Continuing Employee\u2019s service with the Company (as well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company, to the extent service with the predecessor employer was recognized by the Company) shall be treated as service with the Surviving Corporation to the same extent such service was recognized for the same purpose under a similar Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time\u037e provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits or compensation for the same period of service. No Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its predecessors before the Effective Time for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plans or any retiree medical or life insurance or other welfare-type benefits, or for any purposes under any equity or equity-based plans, that are maintained by Parent and its Subsidiaries. \n\n\n(e) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts to, waive, or cause to be waived, any pre- existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any group health benefit plan maintained by the Surviving Corporation in which Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time and in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Employee Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize the dollar amount of all co- payments, deductibles and similar expenses paid by each Continuing Employee (and his or her covered, eligible dependents) during the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year\u2019s deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant group health benefit plans in which they will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time and in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs. \n\n\n(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.16, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an establishment, termination, amendment or other modification of any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement, or shall limit the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to establish, amend, terminate or otherwise modify any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement following the Effective Time. Nothing in this Section 6.16, whether express or implied, shall create any rights or remedies whatsoever, including any third-party beneficiary or other rights, in any Person not a party to this Agreement, or shall be construed to create any right to employment or service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates or continued employment or to any particular term or condition of employment or to limit the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to terminate the employment or service of any service provider (including any Continuing Employee) at any time and for any or no reason. 61\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nARTICLE VII CONDITIONS TO MERGER \n\n\n7.1 Conditions to Each Party\u2019s Obligation To Effect the Merger.
